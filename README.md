# Prediction-Unsupervised-ML
This repository has been created as part of my Data Science and Business Analytics Internship (GRIP) at the Sparks Foundation. The current task is to cluster the iris dataset based on different features such as Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width. The dataset contains 150 observations and 3 different species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica. The dataset has also been attached.

The method used for clustering is K-Means and the optimal number of clusters were chosen based on the popular elbow method.
